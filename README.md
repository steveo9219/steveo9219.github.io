**_updated 6-18-2020 my first project in my portfolio with my group project 1 i worked on with my team_**

For my first portfolio design i have decided to go minimal but still keeping aesthetics looking nice!

The navbar was for a site called bootswatch and the cards are from getbootsrap.com

i kept up the same theme as the given examples in the assests folder.

all links work and the all the DIV tags that came from copy and pasting from the sites were changed and removed

acessibility features were added including semantic HTML and changing HTML language to English

i was able to create a sticky footer for my page and was able to get Javascript to work for my mobile site button drop down

i tried to commit as often as i could and it was nice to save my spot in diffrent times of creating my website, i could see how this could prove invaluable if on a bigger scale.
